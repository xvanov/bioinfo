q1 what is life?
1 why was Darwin's study of finches not so convincing

q2 dna fingerprints
2 when and how are fingerprints formed
3 how are fingerprints identified as matches, how many different fingerprint configs are there?
4 derive formula fro combination and permutation
5 how many possible genomes in total for humans
6 how many genetic sites (provided they contain random nucleotides(need to be checked to uniquely identify a human)
7 how does chi-squared test work
8 what accounts for most differences between individuals

q3 how big is the genome?
9

q1
1
not all organisms share features, but at smaller scale all life is the same: DNA

q2
2 
pseudo-random function of movements of fetus creating ridges and valleys on fingers
3 
fingerprint is divided into 400 non-overlapping sites,rare features (crossovers, spurs, bifurcations) are identified and assigned a direction (4 dirs) if 10 matchh, the fingerprint is a match.
(# of possible groups of 10 sites)*(# of posible direction configurations for those 10 sites)
(400C10)*4^10
4
choose a 3 digit number with digits 0-9 (how many possible numbers) = permuatation
now consider that xyz = zyx = yxz ... how many possible numbers? = combination
5
3 billion nucleotides across 23 chromosomes (4^3billion) = number with over 1 billion digits
6
ceil(log4(7 billion)) = 17
7
hypothesis testing for relation between categorical variables;
we have categories on x and y axes and gatehr data; we make epxected distibution p(x and y) = p(x)*p(y) and find chi2 = sum(real-expected)^2/expected
caclaualte the degree of freedom (r-1)*(c-1) gives chi2 for that df distribution
gives us the p-value (right tail probability that is N0=independent variables is true)
8 
SNP = single nucleotide polymorphisms (differences); on average 1 SNP/1000 base-pairs 0.1% difference, also differnet 3-mers can code to same protein so highly ressitant to snps.
